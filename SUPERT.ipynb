Rick Godinez said.David Morrison, 47, an attorney, was heading to downtown Los Angeles on his regular morning commute. With his tire, apparently caught between the tracks, Mr. Alvarez jumped out of the Jeep and ran. But, Mrs. Alvarez was tracked to a modest home in the north section of Compton. In filing the charges, Cooley said he was unmoved by Alvarezs emotional state before the crash.\\n', \"Authorities believe Juan Manuel Alvarez drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee around the rail crossing barrier and onto the Metrolink train tracks at Chevy Chase Drive in Glendale about 6 a.m. Wednesday. A 25-year-old man was arrested following Wednesday's commuter train collision that killed at least 10 people near downtown Los Angeles. He apparently changed his mind about killing himself, abandoned the vehicle and watched the crash, the Glendale police chief, Randy G. Adams, said. Alvarez is accused of leaving a Jeep Cherokee on the tracks, causing the derailment of one train, which then crashed into another.\\n\", \"Los Angeles County prosecutors on Thursday charged a man with 11 counts of murder, one for every person who died in a violent three-train wreck that they say he caused by driving the man's Jeep onto commuter railroad tracks in a botched suicide attempt. Police arrested a man who they said would be charged with homicide in the crash that left train cars mangled and seared.
