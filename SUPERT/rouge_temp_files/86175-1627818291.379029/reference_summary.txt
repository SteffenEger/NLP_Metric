Alvarez is likely to face at least 10 counts of murder, the chief said. The driver of the SUV, identified as Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, of Compton, Calif., was taken into custody, and police said he would be charged with homicide. A counterterrorism command post was set up near the crash site, but authorities determined within an hour that the disaster was almost certainly the work of one troubled man. He said he got on train 100 at 5:19 a.m. in Simi Valley. ``This is a complete outrage.'' He was told she was taken to the hospital and released.
